Apple Picker
===============

1. Read over Bond Ch 16 where they analyze the Apple Picker and Kaboom! games.
2. Do the Apple Picker tutorial from Bond Chapter 29.
3. Enhance the Finished Apple Picker project in the following ways:
   a. Add a start screen with a start button.
   b. Change the game so that there are 4 baskets instead of 3.
4. Add a UI object at the center top of the game that tells the player what round they are in. It should dtart with saying something like "Round 1" and continue through "Round 4". It should say "Game Over" when the game ends. Also, add a restart button.
5. Add a falling object that you don't want to catch in the basket (for example, a branch). Catching a branch should result in "Game Over." Branches should fall much less frequently than apples.
